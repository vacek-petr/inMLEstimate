# inMLEstimate
Code for reproducing results in P. Vacek, J. Papež and Z. Strakoš, A posteriori error estimates based on multilevel decompositions with large problems on the coarsest level.
MATLAB R2023a is used.

**experiments/effectivityNumberOfLevels.m** with **problemName='3Dpeak'** generates data included in Figure 1  of the paper.

**experiments/effectivitySizeCoarsestLevel.m** with **problemName='3Dpeak'** generates data included in Figures 2-3  of the paper.

## Additional experiments
The repositiory contains 3 additional problems we tested the estimates on 2Dpeak, 2Dshell and 3Dshell, the problem desciptions and results can be found in **additional_numerical_experimets.pdf**.
 

## Multigrid Hierarchies
The multigrid hierarchies were generated by the FE software [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/) (version 2019.1.0), see **matrix_generation/assemble_matrices.py** . The script requires python libraries [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [SciPy](https://scipy.org/), [petsc4py](https://pypi.org/project/petsc4py/). The resulting data were further processed to an object of MultigridHierarchy class using e.g. **data/PROBLEM_NAME/createMultigridHierarchy.m**. 

The MultigridHierarchy objects can be also download at [repository at ZENODO](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.11108596)  and included in data/PROBLEM_NAME/

The initial mesh for the problem 3Dshell can be found in **matrix_generation/3Dshell_meshfile.xml**. It was generated in [HyTeG](https://i10git.cs.fau.de/hyteg/hyteg).
